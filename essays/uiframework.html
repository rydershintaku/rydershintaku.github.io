<h2 id="there-is-no-downside-to-including-an-ui-framework">THERE IS NO DOWNSIDE TO INCLUDING AN UI FRAMEWORK.</h2>

<p>There are apparently people who say that using an ui framework is like learning a whole new language, and is difficult. The whole purpose of bootstrap and other frameworks like it is to 
provide a tool to make your life easier. All it requires is using a tutorial or googling bootstrap “whatever” to see a well thought-out documentation that includes pictures of what the code does, which is really helpful especially because we are coding a website.</p>

<h2 id="bootstrap-and-others-like-it-are-just-a-tool">Bootstrap and others like it are just a tool</h2>

<p>Using tools like bootstrap 5 is just a no brainer when it comes to designing UI Frameworks. If in the worst case, you somehow (impossible) don’t end up using any of the added tools, it doesn’t do any harm to just at least add their link. When comparing my two experiences designing a website with and without it, it just made my life easier to use bootstrap. You can always just use a different tool if you don’t like bootstrap, but the general point still stands that this is a tool that could be used and serves no necessity to include it just like underscore making code more easier/readable in javascript, bootstrap does the same for html/css.</p>

<h2 id="more-options-equals-more-flexibility">More options equals more flexibility</h2>

<p>Using frameworks is like using a newer version of a language that has new features, you could just run python 3.0 and program just fine, but wouldn’t it be better and easier to use 3.8 which adds more functionality like the “walrus” operator. The reason why websites like wix are so popular are because they provide a resource for normal people without coding experience to realize what it looks and feels like to build a website themselves. The same logic applies with bootstrap, just on a more technical level because you do have to have some knowledge but at the end of the day, it’s made to make building a website with less effort.</p>
