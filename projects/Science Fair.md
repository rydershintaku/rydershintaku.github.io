Basically, for my school science fair project which we got into states with we researched the growth of plants using hydroponics, in which we had grown 5 plants using regular traditional methods and 5 other plants using the special water-based nutrient solution and it showed good promise as we had better results aka heavier plant meaning more crop. During this time I was really happy we made it to states because it's supposed to be an accomplishment and was even having expectations for a medal but once I got to states my whole world opened up.

It showed me what real hard work and dedication could get you. Me and my partners just put in just slightly above average effort especially when it came to the scale of the plants, as I still remember one of the judges said “The sample size is really small, this wouldn’t convince many people”. Talking to one other person next to me who eventually won an award, she seemed like she came prepared for the state level as her level of testing was far deeper than ours. Throughout this experience, I learned it really is obvious when you want it more than others.
