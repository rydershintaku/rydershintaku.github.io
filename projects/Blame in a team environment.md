Back in my ICS 311 Class Algorithms, my professor broke us up into randomized groups to work and collaborate with our classmates because he said that every year employers would talk about how new interviewees would be missing the team aspect of their skill set. You can learn all the theory of talking to people you want, nothing is going to simulate the real deal of interacting, and alongside working with people comes responsibility for the given task.

I was part of an esports team last semester. In this league you play against other teams in the same conference (mountain west) teams like SJSU but  we didn't make it far in 
the tournament, failing in the playoffs to the national level. But that wasn't the important part, it was about how it was a team game and I didn't take proper accountability for my own mistakes.

There was one game in particular where I kept dying due to some other laners coming to me and the default position is that everyone should hold their own laners but that wasn’t happening. I now realize that instead of just shrugging it off and saying it was a bad game, I should’ve changed my own movements so that I couldn’t get invaded quite as easily. 

Just like League Of Legends, Software Engineering is a team effort and every person has their own individual part, when someone doesn’t do their part properly it’s easy to give yourself a free pass and shift blame onto someone else and say “Ah well, I did my part so this whole thing isn’t my fault”. This way of thinking is wrong and shouldn’t apply to life in general. If you’re not introspective into your own errors, then it’s very hard to improve as the first step to fixing your mistakes is identifying them. Maybe you truly made zero mistakes, but this type of situation is rare and shouldn’t be a common conclusion. 

Self-reflection is the way to improve even in a team environment. What did I do wrong and what could I have done better?
