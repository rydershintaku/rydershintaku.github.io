I was part of an esports team last semester and we didn't make it far in the tournament, just failing in the local mountain west playoffs. But that wasn't the important part, it was about how it was a team game and I didn't take proper responsibility. 

Just like League Of Legends, software engineering is a team effort and every person has their own individual part, when someone doesn’t do their part properly it’s easy to shift blame onto someone else and say “Ah well, I didn’t mess up as bad as that person so it’s fine”. This way of thinking is wrong and shouldn’t apply to life in general. If you’re not introspective into your own mistakes, then it’s very hard to improve as the first step to fixing your mistakes is identifying them. 

Self-reflection is the way to improve even in a team environment. What could I have done better?
